[1] Generating a list of media to scrape:

- Scrape from a folder:
	You can specify a folder to scrape media information for.
	The folder must contain subfolders or files with the media names.
	The contents of the subfolders themselves will not be scraped.
	Anything in parentheses will be ignored e.g. [ignored] media name (ignored).

- Scrape from user input:
	You can choose to manually input your own media list.

The media names must be reasonably accurate for a reliable scrape.

	*****************************
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[2] Saving the scraped data:

- Default location:
	The scraped data will be saved to the location of the program.

- Different location:
	You can specify a file path to save scraped data.

The scraped data will be saved to a single folder named 'ScrapedData' for a given location.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[3] You can specify to scrape for specific categories (recommended):

- Movie only scrape:
	This will add a movie tag when searching the online database.
	Do this if you are only scraping for movies.

- TV only scrape:
	This will add a TV tag when searching the online database.
	Do this if you are only scraping for TV shows.

- Anime only scrape:
	This will add an anime tag when searching the online database.
	Do this if you are only scraping for anime (movies or TV shows).

- General scrape:
	No tags will be added when searching the online database.
	(If you choose not to specify search tags)

If you specify a TV only scrape you will have the option to also scrape episode information.

[5] Resolving bad scrapes:

- Unsuccessful scraped data:
	Error encountered when searching online.
	Caused by:
	- Interrupted connection to internet
	- Search database server issues (unlikely)
	Options to resolve:
	- Retrying the scrape will usually solve this
	- If this continues after retrying several times, try changing your IP address

- Missing scraped data:
	No results when searching for data.
	Caused by:
	- Incorrect media name
	- Incorrect tags specified
	- Search database missing information
	Options to resolve:
	- Check spelling of media names (cannot change names if you retry the scrape - must restart program)
	- Check if incorrect tags were specified (can change tags upon retry)
	- If correct tags were specified try a general search (can change tags upon retry)
	Missing image/ episode information:
	- If only poster image missing, the search database does not have an image for the particular media.
	- If only episode information missing, the search database does not have episode information listed for the particular media.

- Incorrect scraped data:
	Data scraped for a different media.
	Caused by:
	- Incorrect media name
	- Incorrect tags specified
	- Search database missing information
	Options to resolve:
	- Delete any incorrect scraped files and restart the program with correct names and tags

You will have the option to retry for any bad scrapes (successful scrapes will not be changed).

[6] General tips:

- It is recommended to create separate media lists for movies and TV shows for best results:
	Run the program for movies only and specify movie search tag
	Run the program for TV shows only and specify TV search tag

- If you are scraping for a media list containing a mixture of movies, TV shows and anime it is recommended to:
	Do a general scrape first (no search tags)
	Rescrape with a TV search tag if you also want to scrape any episode information
